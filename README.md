# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Installation

Due to a cors issue with the server, which I don't have access to, the application can only run in certain web browsers. Google Chrome, unfortunately, doesn't
allow me to access the json, but it works fine on Microsoft Edge, which is what I've been using to run tests for the duration of the assignment. It was when I was attempting to do a screen recording in Google Chrome that I realized that it doesn't work in Google Chrome, but weirdly enough, it only works in Google Chrome when the inspect display is up (just right click anywhere on the application, scroll down to "inspect", and refresh the page while inspect is open). If there is a way to
work around this issue, I'd appreciate any assistance.
