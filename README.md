# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

With this assignment, it taught me how to manipulate API in Javascript to get the data that I want. I didn't know that I could nest a fetch within a fetch, but when I
tested it out, it made getting the data that I wanted so much easier. I faced a lot of mind-buggling challenges because I wanted to do more than what was required of
me for the assignment. I started this assignment knowing that I wanted to add it to my portfolio, so I sought to make a weather application that had a lot of my personality in it. I did a lot of testing and ran into a lot of bugs when I thought I solved the problem, but I found myself having fun with the project along the way
even as I encountered many hurdles. I can say that I'm satisfied with how it turned out, but I can always choose to add to it if I wanted.

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I search for a city

THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city

THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history

THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
